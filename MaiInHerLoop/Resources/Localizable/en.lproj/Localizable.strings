"region.north.sections.1.content" = "In the North, one moment you're on open ground, the next you're fighting icy winds along a ridge. \nAltitude steals heat faster than fire can give it back. Veterans never trust a single road, they carry maps in their heads. \nWhen the main pass collapses, they already know the side paths.";
"region.north.sections.1.subtitle" = "Learn them, or be buried with the road.";

"region.north.sections.2.title" = "NO ONE SURVIVES ALONE";
"region.north.sections.2.content" = "Here, survival is a circle. \nVillage committees stockpile food, fuel, medicine before the storms hit. \nIf you're inside, you'll share the fire. If you're outside, you'll watch the smoke from the cold. Join early.";

// MARK: - South Sections
"region.south.sections.1.title" = "THE FLOODS WRITE THEIR OWN LAWS";
"region.south.sections.1.content" = "Here, floods come from the streets. \nRains slam down, drains clog, and motorbikes vanish under filthy water. Rescue crawls through gridlock. \nThe ones who make it are not surprised, they already know which schools and trees turn into shelters.";
